The project is still under active development and will continue to be improved over time.

Currently, it seems that Firefox has limitations when it comes to running Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) using libraries like Workbox or Serwist. While everything runs smoothly in Chrome, the same is not true for Firefox.

You can find an example of this behavior in my repository: [nextjs-pwa](https://github.com/Miftakhul-Ilman-Rifqi/nextjs-pwa), which uses Serwist. The PWA feature works fine in Chrome but is buggy in Firefox. A similar case can be seen in this example repository: [next-serwist-pwa-example](https://github.com/uriseroussi/next-serwist-pwa-example), where the PWA works fine in Chrome but is unreliable in Firefox.

Please correct me if there are any mistakes in my writing, or I don't understand PWAs.

This may be due to the limitations of Firefox's current support for certain PWA features.
