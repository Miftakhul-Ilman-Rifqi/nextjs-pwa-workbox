# Project Status and Browser Compatibility

This project is still under active development and will continue to be improved over time.

Currently, it seems that Firefox has limitations when it comes to running Progressive Web Apps (PWA) using libraries like Workbox or Serwist. While everything works smoothly in Chrome, the same cannot be said for Firefox.

You can find an example of this behavior in my repository: [nextjs-pwa](https://github.com/Miftakhul-Ilman-Rifqi/nextjs-pwa), which uses Serwist. The PWA features function well in Chrome but encounter issues in Firefox. A similar case can be seen in this example repo: [next-serwist-pwa-example](https://github.com/uriseroussi/next-serwist-pwa-example), where the PWA works perfectly in Chrome but not reliably in Firefox.

Please correct me if there are any mistakes in my writing, or I don't understand PWA.

This may be due to current limitations in Firefoxâ€™s support for certain PWA features.
